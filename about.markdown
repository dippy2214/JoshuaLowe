My name is Joshua Lowe, a software developer and student at Abertay University. I enjoy solving new and novel problems with code and am always open to exploring new areas or problem spaces. Making games was my gateway into programming, and I have always enjoyed the visual representation of my work that the medium creates.

After some experimentation in my first year of university with a program to read inputs from wii remotes, something I kept tinkering with on and off through to third year, I realised I liked programming interesting or weird software almost as much as games. I especially enjoyed working on a lower level to understand the tools I was using which set a theme for me in my personal work. Through university I could satisfy the higher level interest in actually making games, and spending in my own time I could work on personal projects to understand how the tools I used work under the hood. This included a software rasteriser, c++ library, working with the c++ linker, making a basic compiler with LLVM and more.

Outside of university and my own programming work/ tinkering I currently enjoy climbing as a social outlet and sport of choice, chess or catan as a fun board game option to flex my competitive side and building lego to spark my creativity.
