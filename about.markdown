My name is Joshua Lowe, a software developer and student at Abertay University. I enjoy solving new and novel problems with code and am always open to explore new areas or problem spaces. Making games was my gateway into programming, and I have always enjoyed the visual representation of my work that the medium creates.

Outside of university and my own programming work/ tinkering I enjoy climbing as a social outlet and a way to keep fit and healthy, chess or catan as a fun board game option to flex my competitive side and lego to spark my creativity.
