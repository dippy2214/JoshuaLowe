# Joshua Lowe's Portfolio
My name is Joshua Lowe, a software developer and student at Abertay University. I enjoy writing all sorts of programs, with a particular interest in lower level programming and new and novel problem solving. I am always eager to try to learn new things, which is how many of these projects came about!

## [Software Rasteriser](https://github.com/dippy2214/Rasteriser) - Finished June 2025
Highlighted skills: C++, Windows API
This project is a software rasteriser with no dependancies outside the standard library, made in C++ as a windows 32 app. The program features a model and image loader to handle objects and textures (.obj and .bmp respectively), simple lighting, and a complete rasteriser to draw to the screen.
## [The Wiimote Project](https://github.com/dippy2214/The-Wiimote-Project) - Finished January 2025 
Highlighted skills: C++, Windows API, (C#, .Net) 
This project is an application which can connect to a wii remote via a bluetooth connection and emulate keyboards inputs based on the wiimotes button presses, motion controls or IR pointer. The program manages the bluetooth connection, decoding the binary data the wii remote sends through its reports, and is coded soley in C++ using the windows API.
